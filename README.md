## About the Video Course
Clients and users are demanding more out of web applications; the traditional web page and HTTP request process is no longer enough. Twilio has taken communication to the next level with its exciting features that cater to both messages and voice calls. It helps the administrator and users to interact with each other in real time. To add to all the fun, Twilio is both easy to understand and implement.

This video course will get you up and running with exciting web services quickly, allowing you to build real-time applications. You will learn to use tools that interact with users beyond the browser for a range of important use cases.

We will start by looking at the tools and services that Pusher and Twilio offer getting to grips with their web interfaces, debug console, and provisioning tools. Mid-way through the tutorial, we’ll look at building useful real-time and communication-based applications and learn how to build applications that can leverage the power of both Twilio and Pusher combined. Then, we will move on to building telephone verification systems with the help of 2-factor authentication tools. Before we reach the end of this course, we will develop innovative IVR systems to guide users through a telephone menu system, and update other users with their progress in real time. Finally, we will create telephone conferencing tools, voicemail services, and automated call-back request systems.

With this course, you will be able to verify your users, deal with their requests, and update them to progress and activities in real time, and much more.
